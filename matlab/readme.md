# Reading Tritech and ARIS data files with Matlab

The example readsonarfile.m shows you how to use the Java library to
read sonar image files into Matlab, access the raw image data, and
transform it into a fan shaped image.

Matlab integration with Java is a core part of Matlab, so no additional
Matlab libraries are required, however you do need to ensure that the
Java library is compatible with your version of Matlab (Java 8 for older
Matlab versions).

Examine the example code and refer to the
[Javadoc](https://douggillespie.github.io/TritechFiles/index.html) for
more detailed information on function calls in the Java library
