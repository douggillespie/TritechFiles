# Reading Tritech and ARIS data files with R

The example readsonarfile.R shows you how to use the Java library to read 
sonar image files into the R language, access the raw image data, and
transform it into a fan shaped image. 

The code uses the [rJava package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html) 

Examine the example code and refer to the [Javadoc](https://douggillespie.github.io/TritechFiles/index.html)
for more detailed information on function calls in the Java library
